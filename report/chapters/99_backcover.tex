\bf{Pose}              & Pose is the combination of position and orientation in 3D space.\vspace{5mm}\\
\bf{Roll, Pitch, Yaw}  & Roll, pitch and yaw angles are one of the ways to characterize a three-dimensional orientation. The roll angle refers to the left/right tilt, the pitch angle is the front/back tilt, and the yaw angle is the rotation angle around a vertical axis.\vspace{5mm}\\
\bf{Keypoint}          & A keypoint is a point of interest detected on an image.\vspace{5mm}\\
\bf{Frame}             & A frame is an image converted into a list of keypoints, with their descriptor and position in the original image.\vspace{5mm}\\
\bf{Keyframe}          & A keyframe is a frame saved in memory alongside with the estimated position from which the image was taken.\vspace{5mm}\\
\bf{Landmark}          & A landmark is an individual point in our 3D map
